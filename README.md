### About Evermint

Evermint is a fork of open source Evmos v12.1.6, maintained by Escan team with bug fixes, customization and enable developers to fork and transform to their chain, fully customized, in just 2 steps.

_Important Note: Evermint was born for development and research purpose so maintainers do not support migration for new upgrade/breaking changes._

### About Evmos

Evmos is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake blockchain
that is fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum.
It's built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/)
which runs on top of the [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft) consensus engine.

### Different of Evermint & Evmos

- Evermint is for research and development purpose.
- Evermint is fork of open source Evmos v12.1.6 plus bug fixes.
- Evermint is [currently removing some modules](https://github.com/EscanBE/evermint/issues/41) from Evmos codebase and only keep `x/evm`, `x/erc20`, `x/feemarket`. The goal is to make it more simple for research and only focus on the skeleton of Evmos.
